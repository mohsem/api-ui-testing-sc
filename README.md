## API and UI Testing
This Maven project provides a simple example for automating tests for [API]( https://petstore.swagger.io/) and [UI](http://www.uitestingplayground.com/). <br/>
<br/>

### libraries used
This project is handled by Maven, so the `pom.xml` file in the root of project defining the dependencies and versions of them. <br/>
(I used JavaCore, Cucumber, Junit, RestAssured, Selenium, PlayWright, and etc.)
<br/>

### Project Structure
The test code is all stored under `src/test/java/com.spritecloud.dummy/`:
* `features`: This folder contains the Cucumber files in `Petstore.feature` and `Playground.feature` files. <br/>
  * As they are defined in `BDD` format, they are **self-explanatory**.
* `steps_definitions`: Here we have classes which contains the implementation of the steps from the Cucumber feature files:
  * `PetStoreStepDefinitions.java`: Implemented by using RestAssured.
  * `PetStoreUserStepDefinitions.java`: Implemented by using RestAssured.
  * `PlaygroundSepDefinitions.java`: Implemented by using PlayWrite.
* `utils`: This package contains a single class: `RequestBodies.java`. It creates and returns JSON requests bodies.
* `TestRunner.java`: This class is main JUnit test runner, decorated with the annotation required to run Cucumber tests.<br/>
  * The class itself is empty, but the `CucumberOptions` annotation defines the location of the features and associated steps.
  <br/>

### Running Tests
For running the tests, the empty `TestRunner.java` class can be executed very simply using a JUnit runner within an IDE.<br/>
Please install the Cucumber plugin to your IDE before running the tests.
(E.g. for [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) use this [link](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/enabling-cucumber-support-in-project.html#cucumber-plugin).)<br/>

Please be informed, In the scenario, I check the available pets increased one after I POST a new pet,<br/>
but as the ENV is NOT **Isolated**, sometimes the available count can increase more than one, and it causes flakiness.<br/>
The same may happen in the DELETE scenario.<br/>
<br/>

### Test Reports
For each test run a report is generated by using the Cucumber `pretty` plugin to produce an HTML report called `cucumber-report.html`<br/>
In the `reports` folder in root. It is very simple and straightforward report.<br/>
I used same plugin for creating `cucumber-report.xml` file to feed the Calliope.pro platform. Here is the Calliope shared [report](https://app.calliope.pro/reports/143234/public/a89fecbf-225a-4a92-869e-5da57e535a96?shc=59653322).<br/>
As CI/CD, I used GHA. Please check the **Actions** tab to see the result and run.<br/>

I chose the scenarios based on the regression scenarios which are suitable for automating.<br/>
(Also, I had an eye on having coverage, especially in API.)<br/>
In the APIs, the response JSON, also the schema of it could be controlled as the next steps.<br/>
